# Muhammad Ukasha's Portfolio:

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases a collection of my projects, primarily developed using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and other powerful libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. Additionally, you'll find some of my smaller game projects built with Pygame, including classics like Minesweeper.

# How to Explore This Repository:

Each project is organized in its own directory with a detailed README file explaining the project's purpose, setup instructions, and how to run the code. Feel free to explore the directories and try out the projects.
